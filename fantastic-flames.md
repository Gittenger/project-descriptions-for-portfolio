# Fantastic Flames

This is a freelance project I created for a client who needed a website to advertise his fire arts entertainment business. The needs are fairly minimal with it being a marketing/landing page. However I included quite a lot of features in its structure so I could work on my development skills.

### Summary of technologies used:

- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- AWS -- EC2 VPS service

## Further details:

I created an entire template of a preferred ReactJS tooling, so that I can start new projects out of the box with **_basic routing_**, **_protected routing_**, **_caching_**, **_easy page creation_**, **_asset indexing_**, and an **_extensible typography system_** including easy use of **_custom fonts_**. I used this system to create the client-side of this page.

For the back-end, I created an API in the MVC style using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Included are features such as **_user authentication_**, **_automated email_**, **_basic CRUD operations_** for placing images on the server, and a **_robust error handling system_**.

The basic function of this back-end with regards to this app is to allow an admin user to access the server and upload and remove custom images to the gallery. It also allows this user to perform password and login related tasks using an automated email system. Another feature is to allow automated emails to come from the front-end if a potential customer wishes to send a booking inquiry.
