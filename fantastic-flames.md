# Fantastic Flames

This is a freelance project I created for a client who needed a website to advertise his fire arts entertainment business. The needs are fairly minimal with it being a marketing/landing page. However I included quite a lot of features in its structure so I could work on my development skills.

Summary of technologies used:

- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- AWS -- EC2 VPS service

Here are some further details:
I created an entire template of a preferred ReactJS tooling, so that I can start new projects out of the box with basic routing, protected routing, caching, easy page creation, asset indexing, and an extensible typography system including easy use of custom fonts. I used this system to create the client-side of this page.

For the back-end, I created an API in the MVC style using Express and MongoDB. Included are features such as user authentication, automated email, basic CRUD operations for placing images on the server, and a robust error handling system. The basic function of this back-end with regards to this app is to allow an admin user to access the server and upload and remove custom images to the gallery. It also allows this user to perform password and login related tasks using an automated email system. Another feature is to allow automated emails to come from the front-end if a potential customer wishes to send a booking inquiry.
