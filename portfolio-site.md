# Portfolio Site

This project is the portfolio site you're visiting now. It's an amalgamation and advertisement of many of my skills and is itself a full-stack React/MERN application with an admin dashboard that allows me to easily manage content on it.

### Summary of technologies used:

- ReactJS
- styled-components
- React Hooks
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- NodeJS
- AWS
- OpenSSH
- Nginx

## Further details:

This project is built on top of a template I originally created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). The entire thing is based off of my full-stack [MERN template](https://johnpittenger.dev/portfolio/mern-template-demo). It contains an admin dashboard which I can log into and update the contents of the site. I use the admin dashboard to manage blog posts, new project postings, and my skills page.

The site is styled using a custom setup I created with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). This setup includes out-of-the-box responsive stylings for typography elements, and easy to integrate media queries. I could easily create a similar site using this same kind of setup, as it's robust, modular and easy to work with.

I deployed the site onto an Amazon EC2 instance via [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and managed the server configuration with [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/).

Finally, I handled securing the site via HTTPS using the ever-ubiquitous [OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH).
