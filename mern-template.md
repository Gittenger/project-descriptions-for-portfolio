# Mern Template

This is actually a combination of a back-end express template with a React app serving as the template for the client-side. This full stack MERN template allows for rapid development of functional web applications through the power of JavaScript.

### Summary of technologies used:

- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Bash/ZSH
- AWS -- EC2 VPS service

## Further details:

This is a template I developed to quickly jump into new web projects with a functional, robust application out of the box, ready to serve as a reliable starting point.

For my ReactJS template, I've built an client which handles **_client-side routing_** -- including **_protected routes_** -- and **_caching_** out of the box. I've used indexing patterns to create **_indexes_** for commonly referenced code such as components or assets.

Similarly, I created a small module which serves to automatically generate CSS code for incoming **_web fonts_**. There is also a **_typography system_** using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) designed to manage many different type faces easily and centrally handle all typography styles.

The back-end template is a basic but foundational MVC application using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Included out of the box are features such as **_user authentication_**, **_automated email_**, **_CRUD operations_**, handling **_form data_**, and a **_robust error handling system_**.

The basic purpose of this template is to allow for a streamlined development experience when building full-stack applications using JavaScript. Using this template gives me a well-equipped app from the get-go, so I can spend more time worrying about business needs or solving more complex problems. Anytime I learn new techniques I can incorporate them into my template, and every project can always be getting better and better, with more time always devoted towards business needs and solving complex problems, rather than redoing things I've already done a hundred times.

Included are some Bash scripts that I run using `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`. These allow me to generate a custom client-side React application, a server-side Express application, or both as a full-stack MERN application in only a single command from the terminal.
