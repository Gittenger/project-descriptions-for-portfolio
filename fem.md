# Frontend Mentor Projects

This is a collection of front-end projects based off of professional design projects provided by the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) site. The projects are implemented with a variety of different front-end tool chains.

### Summary of technologies used:

- ReactJS
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS
- styled-components
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Further details:

Each of these projects are a front-end development challenge presented by Frontend Mentor. Each one is based off of a professionally created design, akin to a real-life application UI design any front-end developer would be developing from in the real world.

Each challenge is different and they vary in difficulty. I've worked on these challenges at various points during my growth as a developer and often use them to hone my skills with a particular front-end workflow that I'm working on at the time. As such, within these projects are a variety of different approaches to building a front-end.

The approaches I've used include most of them using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build my DOM, with each using differing approaches for handling styles. Some have used a front-end template that I created using React and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Others use React with Tailwind CSS. At least one project is built using plain HTML and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) compiling down to plain CSS. In this case, a simple plain JavaScript file was used to handle DOM manipulation to toggle state.

These projects, in summary, are a good representation of some of my capabilities as a front-end developer especially when provided with design files or a style guide.
